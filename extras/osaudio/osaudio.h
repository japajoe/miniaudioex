/*
This is a simple API for low-level audio playback and capture. A reference implementation using
miniaudio is provided in osaudio.c which can be found alongside this file. Consider all code
public domain.

The idea behind this project came about after considering the absurd complexity of audio APIs on
various platforms after years of working on miniaudio. This project aims to disprove the idea that
complete and flexible audio solutions and simple APIs are mutually exclusive and that it's possible
to have both. The idea of reliability through simplicity is the first and foremost goal of this
project. The difference between this project and miniaudio is that this project is designed around
the idea of what I would build if I was building an audio API for an operating system, such as at
the level of WASAPI or ALSA. A cross-platform and cross-backend library like miniaudio is
necessarily different in design, but there are indeed things that I would have done differently if
given my time again, some of those ideas of which I'm expressing in this project.

---

The concept of low-level audio is simple - you have a device, such as a speaker system or a
micrphone system, and then you write or read audio data to/from it. So in the case of playback, you
need only write your raw audio data to the device which then emits it from the speakers when it's
ready. Likewise, for capture you simply read audio data from the device which is filled with data
by the microphone.

A complete low-level audio solution requires the following:

    1) The ability to enumerate devices that are connected to the system.
    2) The ability to open and close a connection to a device.
    3) The ability to start and stop the device.
    4) The ability to write and read audio data to/from the device.
    5) The ability to query the device for it's data configuration.
    6) The ability to notify the application when certain events occur, such as the device being
       stopped, or rerouted.

The API presented here aims to meet all of the above requirements. It uses a single-threaded
blocking read/write model for data delivery instead of a callback model. This makes it a bit more
flexible since it gives the application full control over the audio thread. It might also make it
more feasible to use this API on single-threaded systems.

Device enumeration is achieved with a single function: osaudio_enumerate(). This function returns
an array of osaudio_info_t structures which contain information about each device. The array is
allocated must be freed with free(). Contained within the osaudio_info_t struct is, most
importantly, the device ID, which is used to open a connection to the device, and the name of the
device which can be used to display to the user. For advanced users, it also includes information
about the device's native data configuration.

Opening and closing a connection to a device is achieved with osaudio_open() and osaudio_close().
An important concept is that of the ability to configure the device. This is achieved with the
osaudio_config_t structure which is passed to osaudio_open(). In addition to the ID of the device,
this structure includes information about the desired format, channel count and sample rate. You
can also configure the latency of the device, or the buffer size, which is specified in frames. A
flags member is used for specifying additional options, such as whether or not to disable automatic
rerouting. Finally a callback can be specified for notifications. When osaudio_open() returns, the
config structure will be filled with the device's actual configuration. You can inspect the channel
map from this structure to know how to arrange the channels in your audio data.

This API uses a blocking write/read model for pushing and pulling data to/from the device. This
is done with the osaudio_write() and osaudio_read() functions. These functions will block until
the requested number of frames have been processed or the device is drained or flushed with
osaudio_drain() or osaudio_flush() respectively. It is from these functions that the device is
started. As soon as you start writing data with osaudio_write() or reading data with
osaudio_read(), the device will start. When the device is drained of flushed with osaudio_drain()
or osaudio_flush(), the device will be stopped. osaudio_drain() will block until the device has
been drained, whereas osaudio_flush() will stop playback immediately and return. You can also pause
and resume the device with osaudio_pause() and osaudio_resume(). Since reading and writing is
blocking, it can be useful to know how many frames can be written/read without blocking. This is
achieved with osaudio_get_avail().

Querying the device's configuration is achieved with osaudio_get_info(). This function will return
a pointer to a osaudio_info_t structure which contains information about the device, most
importantly it's name and data configuration. The name is important for displaying on a UI, and
the data configuration is important for knowing how to format your audio data. The osaudio_info_t
structure will contain an array of osaudio_config_t structures. This will contain one entry, which
will contain the exact information that was returned in the config structure that was passed to
osaudio_open().

A common requirement is to open a device that represents the operating system's default device.
This is done easily by simply passing in NULL for the device ID. Below is an example for opening a
default device:

    int result;
    osaudio_t audio;
    osaudio_config_t config;

    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);
    config.format   = OSAUDIO_FORMAT_F32;
    config.channels = 2;
    config.rate     = 48000;

    result = osaudio_open(&audio, &config);
    if (result != OSAUDIO_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to open device.");
        return -1;
    }

    ...

    osaudio_close(audio);

In the above example, the default device is opened for playback (OSAUDIO_OUTPUT). The format is
set to 32-bit floating point (OSAUDIO_FORMAT_F32), the channel count is set to stereo (2), and the
sample rate is set to 48kHz. The device is then closed when we're done with it.

If instead we wanted to open a specific device, we can do that by passing in the device ID. Below
is an example for how to do this:

    int result;
    osaudio_t audio;
    osaudio_config_t config;
    unsigned int infoCount;
    osaudio_info_t* info;

    result = osaudio_enumerate(&infoCount, &info);
    if (result != OSAUDIO_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to enumerate devices.\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // ... Iterate over the `info` array and find the device you want to open. Use the `direction` member to discriminate between input and output ...

    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);
    config.id       = &info[indexOfYourChosenDevice].id;
    config.format   = OSAUDIO_FORMAT_F32;
    config.channels = 2;
    config.rate     = 48000;

    osaudio_open(&audio, &config);

    ...

    osaudio_close(audio);
    free(info); // The pointer returned by osaudio_enumerate() must be freed with free().

The id structure is just a 256 byte array that uniquely identifies the device. Implementations may
have different representations for device IDs, and A 256 byte array should accomodates all
device ID representations. Implementations are required to zero-fill unused bytes. The osaudio_id_t
structure can be copied which makes it suitable for serialization and deserialization in situations
where you may want to save the device ID to permanent storage so it can be stored in a config file.

Implementations need to do their own data conversion between the device's native data configuration
and the requested configuration. In this case, when the format, channels and rate are specified in
the config, they should be unchanged when osaudio_open() returns. If this is not possible,
osaudio_open() will return OSAUDIO_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED. However, there are cases where it's useful
for a program to use the device's native configuration instead of some fixed configuration. This is
achieved by setting the format, channels and rate to 0. Below is an example:

    int result;
    osaudio_t audio;
    osaudio_config_t config;

    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);

    result = osaudio_open(&audio, &config);
    if (result != OSAUDIO_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to open device.");
        return -1;
    }

    // ... `config` will have been updated by osaudio_open() to contain the *actual* format/channels/rate ...

    osaudio_close(audio);

In addition to the code above, you can explicitly call `osaudio_get_info()` to retrieve the format
configuration. If you need to know the native configuration before opening the device, you can use
enumeration. The format, channels and rate will be contined in the first item in the configs array.

The examples above all use playback, but the same applies for capture. The only difference is that
the direction is set to OSAUDIO_INPUT instead of OSAUDIO_OUTPUT.

To output audio from the speakers you need to call osaudio_write(). Likewise, to capture audio from
a microphone you need to call osaudio_read(). These functions will block until the requested number
of frames have been written or read. The device will start automatically. Below is an example for
writing some data to a device:

    int result = osaudio_write(audio, myAudioData, myAudioDataFrameCount);
    if (result == OSAUDIO_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Successfully wrote %d frames of audio data.\n", myAudioDataFrameCount);
    } else {
        printf("Failed to write audio data.\n");
    }

osaudio_write() and osaudio_read() will return OSAUDIO_SUCCESS if the requested number of frames
were written or read. You cannot call osaudio_close() while a write or read operation is in
progress.

If you want to write or read audio data without blocking, you can use osaudio_get_avail() to
determine how many frames are available for writing or reading. Below is an example:

    unsigned int framesAvailable = osaudio_get_avail(audio);
    if (result > 0) {
        printf("There are %d frames available for writing.\n", framesAvailable);
    } else {
        printf("There are no frames available for writing.\n");
    }

If you want to abort a blocking write or read, you can use osaudio_flush(). This will result in any
pending write or read operation being aborted.

There are several ways of pausing a device. The first is to just drain or flush the device and
simply don't do any more read/write operations. A drain and flush will put the device into a
stopped state until the next call to either read or write, depending on the device's direction.
If, however, this does not suit your requirements, you can use osaudio_pause() and
osaudio_resume(). Take note, however, that these functions will result in osaudio_drain() never
returning because it'll result in the device being in a stopped state which in turn results in the
buffer never being read and therefore never drained.

Everything is thread safe with a few minor exceptions which has no practical issues for the client:
    
    * You cannot call any function while osaudio_open() is still in progress.
    * You cannot call osaudio_close() while any other function is still in progress.
    * You can only call osaudio_write() and osaudio_read() from one thread at a time.

None of these issues should be a problem for the client in practice. You won't have a valid
osaudio_t object until osaudio_open() has returned. For osaudio_close(), it makes no sense to
destroy the object while it's still in use, and doing so would mean the client is using very poor
form. For osaudio_write() and osaudio_read(), you wouldn't ever want to call this simultaneously
across multiple threads anyway because otherwise you'd end up with garbage audio.

The rules above only apply when working with a single osaudio_t object. You can have multiple
osaudio_t objects open at the same time, and you can call any function on different osaudio_t
objects simultaneously from different threads.

# Feedback

I'm looking for feedback on the following:

  * Are the supported formats enough? If not, what other formats are needed, and what is the
    justification for including it? Just because it's the native format on one particular
    piece of hardware is not enough. Big-endian and little-endian will never be supported. All
    formats are native-endian.
  * Are the available channel positions enough? What other positions are needed?
  * Just some general criticism would be appreciated.

osaudio_config_t is a transparent struct. Just set the relevant fields to the desired values after

/*
Opens a connection to a device.

On input, config must be filled with the desired configuration. On output, it will be filled with
the actual configuration.

Initialize the config with osaudio_config_init() and then fill in the desired configuration. Below
is an example:

    osaudio_config_t config;
    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);
    config.format   = OSAUDIO_FORMAT_F32;
    config.channels = 2;
    config.rate     = 48000;

When the format, channels or rate are left at their default values, or set to 0 (or
OSAUDIO_FORMAT_UNKNOWN for format), the native format, channels or rate will use the device's
native configuration:

    osaudio_config_t config;
    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);
    config.format   = OSAUDIO_FORMAT_UNKNOWN;
    config.channels = 0;
    config.rate     = 0;

The code above is equivalent to this:

    osaudio_config_t config;
    osaudio_config_init(&config, OSAUDIO_OUTPUT);

On output the config will be filled with the actual configuration. The implementation will perform
any necessary data conversion between the requested data configuration and the device's native

case the caller can decide to reinitialize the device to use it's native configuration and do it's
own data conversion, or abort if it cannot do so. Use the channel map to determine the ordering of
your channels. Automatic channel map conversion is not performed - that must be done manually by
the caller when transfering data to/from the device.
